# Pandas_Challenge
Homework Submission for Pandas

## Approach

Having the sample tables available as a starting point was very helpful. My approach was to simply generate each individual value/set of values required, print those and then aggregate them all together in a DataFrame at the end.

## Challenges

I took a different approach for the averages by grade, where I find vertical tables more usable than horizontal table columns. It took a while to sort the grades as they had the "th" at the end. I was able to finally get that.
The binning also took some time because of the .loc, which luckily Pandas told me was preferable to the double square brackets I used.

## Overall Thoughts

I had heard this was the harder of the two options, and it did not disappoint! I think this exercise will be more relevant for me in my future endeavors, so I'm glad I did it. Very difficult, but also pretty fun.
